client side java code for android socket.o-demo

Its an android chat app(like whatsapp) with google map integration. At the launch there is a login panel and after successful login you will be directed to a screen where you will get the option of group chat and private chat with anyone whose number is their in your contactlist. In group chat any number of candidates can join at anytime and also can leave at any time and in private chat only 2 candidates can chat and the candidate can see other candidate(the person to whom they are talking) location in google map. And in group as well as private chat candidate can send text as well as images. For making this app I have used sockets in Node.js server side and android in client side.
